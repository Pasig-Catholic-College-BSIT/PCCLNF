# 🧭 Lost and Found System

## Project Title
**Lost and Found System**  
An online platform for managing and returning misplaced items within the school community.

## Description
The Lost and Found System is a web-based application that allows students and staff to report, post, and claim lost items efficiently.  
It simplifies the process of identifying and retrieving lost belongings by storing item details in a central online database accessible across devices.

**Problem it solves:**
Traditional lost and found processes rely on manual recording and physical logs, making it slow and inconsistent. This system digitizes the process — improving accuracy, transparency, and accessibility.
